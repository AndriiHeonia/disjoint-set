Disjoint-set data structure is a data structure that keeps track of a set of elements partitioned into a number of disjoint (non overlapping) subsets. A union–find algorithm is an algorithm that performs two useful operations on such a data structure:

* Find: Determine which subset a particular element is in. This can be used for determining if two elements are in the same subset;
* Union: Join two subsets into a single subset.
